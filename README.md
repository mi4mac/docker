- health_check.py: Health monitoring functionality

Feature Modules
- containers.py: Container lifecycle management (20 operations)
- images.py: Docker image management (9 operations)  
- networks.py: Network management (7 operations)
- volumes.py: Volume management (5 operations)
- system_ops.py: System-level operations (4 operations)

Technical Implementation
------------------------

HTTP Communication
- RESTful API: Uses Docker Engine REST API with configurable versioning (v1.40+)
- Request Handling: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- Response Processing: Automatic JSON parsing with fallback to text
- Query Parameters: Proper URL encoding and parameter handling
- Headers Management: Dynamic header construction for different content types
- Registry Authentication: X-Registry-Auth header support for private registries

Error Handling
- Input Validation: Required parameter checking with descriptive error messages
- HTTP Error Handling: Specific status code handling (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500, 503)
- Exception Management: Proper exception propagation with logging
- Retry Logic: Automatic retry for transient failures with exponential backoff
- Timeout Support: Configurable request timeouts (default 60 seconds)

Security Features
- SSL/TLS Security: Configurable SSL certificate validation
- Client Certificates: Support for client certificate authentication
- CA Certificate Validation: Custom CA certificate support
- Authentication: Multiple authentication methods supported
- Token-based Auth: Bearer token support for modern authentication
- Registry Authentication: Docker registry authentication with X-Registry-Auth
- Rate Limiting: Configurable request rate limiting (requests per minute)
- Credential Management: Secure handling of usernames, passwords, and tokens

Dependencies
