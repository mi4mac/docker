Docker Connector Summary

Overview
The Docker Connector v1.3.0 is a comprehensive FortiSOAR connector that provides full integration with the Docker Engine API. It enables FortiSOAR to interact with Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes through a robust set of 50+ operations with enhanced validation and error handling.

Architecture & Structure

Core Components:
- connector.py - Main connector class that routes operations and handles health checks
- builtins.py - Central registry mapping operation names to their implementations
- utils.py - Core utility functions for HTTP requests, authentication, and error handling
- health_check.py - Connector availability verification
- constants.py - Configuration constants

Operation Categories:
- system_ops.py - System-level operations (4 operations)
- containers.py - Container management operations (19 operations)
- images.py - Image management operations (9 operations)
- networks.py - Network management operations (7 operations)
- volumes.py - Volume management operations (5 operations)

Key Features

Authentication & Security:
- Multiple Auth Methods: Username/password, access tokens, Bearer tokens
- SSL/TLS Support: Configurable SSL verification with custom certificates
- Client Certificates: Support for client certificate authentication
- Registry Authentication: Docker registry authentication for image operations

Robust HTTP Handling:
- Retry Logic: Automatic retries for transient failures (configurable attempts/delay)
- Rate Limiting: Configurable requests per minute to prevent API overload
- Timeout Management: Configurable request timeouts (default: 60 seconds)
- Error Handling: Comprehensive HTTP status code handling with specific error messages

Connection Management:
- Health Checks: Non-intrusive availability verification
- Connection Pooling: Efficient connection reuse
- SSL Context: Flexible SSL configuration with certificate validation

Operations Summary

System Operations (4):

- Connectivity: connect_network, disconnect_network
- Cleanup: prune_networks

Volume Operations (5):
- Management: list_volumes, inspect_volume, create_volume, remove_volume
- Cleanup: prune_volumes

Configuration Options

Connection Settings:
- Server Address (required) - Docker Engine host
- Port (default: 2376) - Docker Engine port
- Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) - Connection protocol
- API Version (v1.40-v1.43) - Docker API version

Authentication:
- Username/Password - Basic authentication
- Access Token - Bearer token authentication
- Registry Credentials - Docker registry authentication

Security:
- SSL Verification - Enable/disable SSL certificate verification
- Client Certificates - Certificate and key file paths
- CA Certificate - Custom CA certificate path

Performance:
- Request Timeout (default: 60s) - Request timeout in seconds
- Rate Limiting (default: 60/min) - Requests per minute limit
- Retry Attempts (default: 3) - Number of retry attempts
- Retry Delay (default: 1s) - Delay between retries

Technical Implementation

Error Handling:
- HTTP Status Codes: Specific handling for 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500, 503
- Network Errors: Timeout and connection error handling with retries
- JSON Parsing: Graceful handling of non-JSON responses
- Logging: Comprehensive error logging with context

Import Structure:
- Consolidated Operations: Operations grouped by functionality for maintainability
- Robust Imports: Try/except patterns for FortiSOAR compatibility
- Package Structure: Proper Python package organization with __init__.py

API Integration:
- Docker Engine API: Full compliance with Docker Engine API v1.40-v1.43
- RESTful Design: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Query Parameters: Support for filtering, pagination, and options
- Request/Response: JSON-based communication with fallback to text
