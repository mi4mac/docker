Project Overview
----------------
This is a FortiSOAR connector for Docker Engine API, designed to integrate Docker container management capabilities into the FortiSOAR security orchestration platform. The connector provides comprehensive Docker operations through a REST API interface.

Architecture & Structure
------------------------

Core Components
- connector.py: Main connector class that handles operation routing and health checks
- builtins.py: Central registry mapping operation names to their implementations
- utils.py: Core utility functions for HTTP communication and authentication
- constants.py: Logger configuration constants
- health_check.py: Health monitoring functionality

Feature Modules
- containers.py: Container lifecycle management (12 operations)
- images.py: Docker image management (6 operations)  
- networks.py: Network management (7 operations)
- volumes.py: Volume management (5 operations)
- system_ops.py: System-level operations (4 operations)

Implemented Features
--------------------

Configuration & Authentication
- Server Configuration: Address, port (default 2376), protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Authentication Methods: 
  - Username/password authentication
  - Access token (Bearer token)
  - SSL verification toggle
- Flexible Connection: Supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols

Container Management (12 Operations)
1. list_containers - List all containers (with optional "all" flag)
2. inspect_container - Get detailed container information
3. create_container - Create new containers with custom configuration
4. start_container - Start stopped containers
5. stop_container - Stop running containers (with timeout option)
6. restart_container - Restart containers (with timeout option)
7. kill_container - Send signals to containers
8. remove_container - Delete containers (with force option)
9. rename_container - Rename existing containers
10. container_logs - Fetch container logs (stdout/stderr, with tail option)
11. exec_container - Execute commands inside running containers
12. prune_containers - Remove unused containers

Image Management (6 Operations)
1. list_images - List all Docker images
2. pull_image - Download images from registries
3. inspect_image - Get detailed image information
4. remove_image - Delete images (with force and noprune options)
5. tag_image - Tag images for repositories
6. prune_images - Remove unused images

Network Management (7 Operations)
1. list_networks - List all networks
2. inspect_network - Get detailed network information
3. create_network - Create new networks with custom drivers and IPAM
4. connect_network - Connect containers to networks
5. disconnect_network - Disconnect containers from networks
6. remove_network - Delete networks
7. prune_networks - Remove unused networks

Volume Management (5 Operations)
1. list_volumes - List all volumes
2. inspect_volume - Get detailed volume information
3. create_volume - Create new volumes with custom drivers and options
4. remove_volume - Delete volumes (with force option)
5. prune_volumes - Remove unused volumes

System Operations (4 Operations)
1. get_version - Get Docker Engine version information
2. get_info - Get comprehensive system information
3. system_df - Get disk usage statistics
4. system_events - Get system events with filtering (since/until timestamps)

Technical Implementation
------------------------

HTTP Communication
- RESTful API: Uses Docker Engine REST API v1.40+
- Request Handling: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- Response Processing: Automatic JSON parsing with fallback to text
- Query Parameters: Proper URL encoding and parameter handling
- Headers Management: Dynamic header construction for different content types

Error Handling
- Input Validation: Required parameter checking with descriptive error messages
- HTTP Error Handling: Status code checking with detailed error responses
- Exception Management: Proper exception propagation with logging
- Timeout Support: Configurable request timeouts (default 60 seconds)

Security Features
- SSL Verification: Configurable SSL certificate validation
- Authentication: Multiple authentication methods supported
- Token-based Auth: Bearer token support for modern authentication
- Credential Management: Secure handling of usernames, passwords, and tokens

Dependencies
------------
- requests: HTTP library for API communication
- FortiSOAR Framework: Core connector infrastructure
- Django: Module loading utilities

Sample Files
------------
The project includes sample implementation files (sample_*.py) demonstrating:
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operation patterns
- Parameter validation
- Response transformation
- Error handling best practices

Key Strengths
-------------
1. Comprehensive Coverage: All major Docker operations supported
2. Production Ready: Robust error handling and logging
3. Flexible Configuration: Multiple authentication and connection options
4. Modular Design: Clean separation of concerns across different resource types
5. FortiSOAR Integration: Proper connector framework implementation
6. Extensible: Easy to add new operations following established patterns

Summary
-------
This connector provides a complete Docker management solution for FortiSOAR users, enabling automated container orchestration, monitoring, and management within security workflows.
